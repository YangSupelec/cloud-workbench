# Vendor Assets

Basically the vendor assets shouldn't be modified such that they and can be easily updated to newer versions.
Use LESS variables and overrides to customize vendor assets.
However, sometimes it is not possible (with acceptable effort) to customize vendor assets.
This readme documents the modification made to the vendor assets.


## Overrides

Especially see bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less in the app/assets directory for Bootstrap related import and overrides.


## Modification
